# Farm Size vs Income Simulator

## Overview

The Farm Size vs Income Simulator is a Streamlit-based web application designed to simulate the income for smallholder cocoa farms. It allows users to visualize how changes in farming practices, market conditions, and farm inputs can influence the income of these farms. The app provides a user-friendly interface for adjusting input parameters and viewing the impacts on farm income through interactive visualizations.
Features

    * Interactive Sliders: Adjust parameters such as farm size, yield per hectare, material costs per hectare, and labor time per hectare.
    * Input Boxes: Input constants like Cocoa Market Price, Maximum Labor Time, and Labor Cost.
    * Graphical Visualization: View how income changes with farm size for different parameter settings through an Altair line chart.
    * Detailed Data Table: Review the data points plotted in the chart in tabular format.
    * Labor Management Indicator: Understand when additional labor is required beyond what a single farmer can manage.

## Model Parameters

    * Farm Size: Size of the farm in hectares.
    * Yield per Hectare (YH): Cocoa yield per hectare (units/year).
    * Material Costs per Hectare (MCH): Costs for materials like fertilizers and pesticides (USD/hectare).
    * Labor Time per Hectare (LTH): Labor time required per hectare (days/year).
    * Cocoa Market Price (CMP): Selling price of cocoa per unit (USD/unit).
    * Maximum Labor Time (MLT): Maximum number of days a single farmer can work in a year.
    * Labor Cost (LC): Cost per day of labor (USD/day).

## Usage

The app is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Adjust the sliders and input boxes to simulate different scenarios and instantly view the updated results in the charts and data table. Use this tool to explore how various factors affect the income of smallholder cocoa farms and to make informed decisions or policy recommendations.
